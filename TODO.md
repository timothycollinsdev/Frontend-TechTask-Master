- use of ui framework for reusable components and responsive for mobile and web. Also to avoid custom css as much as possible .e.g. tailwind css
- state management .e.g. contextApi/redux. To manage the global state of application through central store and avoid prop drilling
- pagination/lazy loading to load only few items first and then next based on demand. To avoid load on application while fetching all at once.
- ui and design improvement as there are few changes left for sidebar and overall.
